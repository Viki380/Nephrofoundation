    <h3>Understanding Your Kidneys</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        Your kidneys are remarkable organs that work silently around the clock to keep your body in balance. This article will provide a clear, simple overview of what your kidneys are, where they are located, and the vital functions they perform every single day.

    <h4 id="understanding-anatomy">What are Kidneys and Where are They?</h4>
    <p>
        Humans typically have two kidneys, each about the size of a fist. They are bean-shaped organs located on either side of your spine, just below the rib cage. You can imagine them situated towards your back, which is why some kidney-related pain can be felt in the flank area.

    <h4 id="understanding-filtering">How Do Kidneys Work? The Filtering Process</h4>
    <p>
        Think of your kidneys as a highly advanced purification system. Your entire blood supply passes through them several times a day. Inside each kidney are about a million tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron contains a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes.

    <p>The process is simple yet elegant:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-6">
        <li>Blood enters the kidney's nephrons.</li>
        <li>Waste products (like urea and creatinine) and excess water are filtered out in the glomerulus.</li>
        <li>Essential minerals and most of the water are reabsorbed back into the blood through the tubule.</li>
        <li>The remaining waste products and excess water become urine.</li>
        <li>Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Your kidneys are vital, complex organs responsible for much more than just producing urine. Understanding their function is the first step towards protecting them.
