    <h3>Monitoring & Kidney Tests</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        Regular monitoring through blood and urine tests is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). These tests allow your nephrologist to track the health of your kidneys, see how well your treatment is working, and catch potential complications early.

    <h4 id="monitoring-egfr" class="mt-12">1. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)</h4>
    <p>
        The eGFR is the best measure of your kidney function. It's a calculation based on your blood creatinine level, age, and sex. A higher eGFR is better. An eGFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease.
    </p>
    <h4 id="monitoring-uacr" class="mt-12">2. Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR)</h4>
    <p>
        This urine test checks for the presence of albumin, a type of protein, in your urine. Healthy kidneys do not let albumin pass from the blood into the urine. The presence of albumin in the urine (called albuminuria) is an early sign of kidney damage.

            Knowing your numbers is crucial. Keep a record of your lab results and don't hesitate to ask your nephrologist what they mean for your health and treatment plan.
