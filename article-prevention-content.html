    <h3>Prevention & Risk Factors</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        While some causes of kidney disease are not preventable, many cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are linked to other health conditions and lifestyle factors that you can control. By understanding and managing your personal risk factors, you can take powerful steps to protect your kidneys and preserve their function for as long as possible.

    <h4 id="prevention-primary" class="mt-12">The Primary Risk Factors</h4>
    <p>
        In India and across the globe, two conditions are responsible for the majority of CKD cases. Managing them is the single most important part of kidney disease prevention.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-6">
        <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Uncontrolled high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels and filters (glomeruli) in the kidneys over many years. This damage, known as diabetic nephropathy, is the leading cause of kidney failure.</li>
        <li><strong>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</strong> High pressure in your blood vessels also damages the delicate filters in the kidneys, making it harder for them to remove waste and extra fluid from your body.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="prevention-steps" class="mt-12">Practical Steps for Prevention</h4>
    <p>
        The best way to protect your kidneys is through a healthy lifestyle and regular medical care, especially if you are in a high-risk group.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-6">
        <li><strong>Get Tested:</strong> If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a family history of kidney disease, you should have your kidney function checked regularly with simple blood (eGFR) and urine (UACR) tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Your Conditions:</strong> Work closely with your doctor to keep your blood sugar and blood pressure within your target range.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow a Healthy Diet:</strong> Reduce your salt intake, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and avoid processed foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Active:</strong> Regular physical activity helps control blood pressure and blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Medications:</strong> Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding medications, especially painkillers like NSAIDs.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Kidney disease often has no symptoms in its early stages. Therefore, prevention and early detection are crucial. By managing your risk factors, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing serious kidney problems.
