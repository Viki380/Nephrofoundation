    <h3>Treatment Options for Kidney Disease</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        When chronic kidney disease progresses to its final stage, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or kidney failure (typically an eGFR below 15), your kidneys are no longer able to adequately filter your blood. At this point, a life-sustaining treatment is needed to perform the work of the kidneys. The main treatment options are dialysis and kidney transplantation.
    </p>
    <h4 id="treatment-hd" class="mt-12">1. Hemodialysis (HD)</h4>
    <p>
        This is the most common type of dialysis. During HD, your blood is pumped out of your body to an artificial kidney machine (a dialyzer), where it is cleaned of waste and excess fluid before being returned to your body. It is typically done at a dialysis center three times a week.

    <h4 id="treatment-pd" class="mt-12">2. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</h4>
    <p>
        Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your own abdomen, called the peritoneal membrane, as a natural filter. A soft plastic tube (catheter) is placed into your abdomen through surgery. This is a home-based therapy.
    </p>
    <h4 id="treatment-transplant" class="mt-12">3. Kidney Transplant</h4>
    <p>
        A kidney transplant is a surgery to place a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. The new kidney takes over the work of your failed kidneys. A successful transplant is the closest thing to a cure but requires lifelong anti-rejection medications.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Each treatment option has significant benefits and challenges. The best choice is highly personal and should be made after in-depth discussions with your nephrologist and family.
