    <h3>Lifestyle & Diet for Kidney Health</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        For individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), what you eat and how you live has a direct and powerful impact on your health. A "kidney-friendly" or "renal" diet is designed to reduce the amount of waste and fluid your kidneys have to handle, which can help slow the progression of CKD and prevent complications.

    <h4 id="lifestyle-minerals" class="mt-12">The "Big Three" to Monitor: Sodium, Potassium, Phosphorus</h4>
    <p>
        Most renal diets focus on limiting these three key minerals, which can build up to harmful levels in the blood when kidney function is low. This involves avoiding processed foods, limiting high-potassium foods like bananas and tomatoes, and managing phosphorus intake from dairy and nuts.
    </p>
    <h4 id="lifestyle-protein" class="mt-12">Protein and Fluid Management</h4>
    <p>
        Managing protein and fluid intake is also crucial. Your doctor may recommend limiting protein in the earlier stages of CKD. As the disease progresses, your fluid intake may also need to be restricted to prevent swelling.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            A renal diet is a critical part of your treatment plan. It is not about eliminating all the foods you love, but about learning to make smart choices, control portion sizes, and prepare food in a kidney-friendly way.
